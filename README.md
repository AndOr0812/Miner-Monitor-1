## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for developement and testing purposes.

### Perequisites

```
NodeJS
```

### Installing

```
apt-get install nodejs
```

### Runing the file

```
To log values from the antminers currently you will have to configure passwordless ssh entry into your antminers from the machine you are running this file on. Then you will have to change the file to your ips. Then run it on your machine by going ./get-miner-values. All this will effectively do as of now is log out temps, hashrate and other important data into mqtt variables.
